## Definitions

**Developer**:
Andrew Stretton

**Client**:
Media Measurement Ltd.

**Services**:
Any task or series of tasks done by the Developer on request from the Client,
or as part of fulfilling a request from the Client.

**Product**:
Any code, images, markup, scripts, content created by the Developer while
performing Services.

**Intangibles**:
Knowledge about solutions to problems, methods, or designs.

## Terms

1. **Rate**:
Services shall be billed to the Client at the rate of £100 per hour.

2. **Payment**:
The Client shall send payment to the Developer within 30 days of receiving
an invoice.
	
	1. **Late Payment**:
	If a payment is more than 30 days late, no Services will be performed for the
	Client until payment is received.

3. **Billable Time**:
All time spent performing Services and communicating with the Client is
billable.

	1. **Estimations**:
	If an estimate is requested by the Client, the developer reserves the right to ask for
billed time to do the estimation if it is complex.

4. **Copyright**:
Copyright of all Products created while performing Services for the Client will
be transferred to the Client upon receipt of payment in full, except in the
cases described below.

5. **Copyright Exceptions**
	1. The Developer reserves the right to reuse and re-license portions of the
created Product as desired, as long as the portions are general solutions
to common problems and are not specific to the Client's product. The expected result of this
provision is that work on dashboards or specialist data augmentations is copyright to the client. 
Work on standard input output from well known platforms will be open source.
	2. Any portions of the Product whose copyright is withheld by the developer
are licensed to the Client for use in the Product under the MIT license:
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php
	3. The Client will only be billed for portions of the Product which were
created during the effective period of this contract and created while
performing Services for the Client.
	4. We love to show off our work and share what we’ve learned with other people, 
so we reserve the right, with your permission, to discuss your project at networking events,
interviews and in blog posts.

6. **Intangible Property**:
The Developer retains ownership of all Intangibles gained by the Developer
(that are not previously owned by the Client) while providing Services. That said, technical documentation
on how to install and run the services will be provided on request free of charge.

7. **Termination**:
Either party must give at least 14 days notice to the other party before
termination.  This contract may only be terminated after all outstanding
invoices have been paid in full.

8. **Changes**:
Either party may request to modify the terms of this contract at any time.
When both parties consent to new terms and a new contract is signed, this
contract is terminated immediately.

9. **Liability**
The developer can’t guarantee that our work will be error-free and so can’t be liable to you or any third-party 
for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, 
even if they are advised to him. That said, the developer undertakes to substansively deliver the functionality 
described in the attached schedule of work for the agreed price and therfore accept that payment will only 
be received when a revision is substansively complete.

10 **Technical Support**
The application will be supported (major bugs fixed, patches applied) for 60 days following the agreed delivery.
After this a separate SLA will be required either from the developer or another provider. Should detailed technical
documentation be required for a change of provider this will be chargeable.

Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, 
or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and 
shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under 
exclusive jurisdiction of English and Welsh courts.
